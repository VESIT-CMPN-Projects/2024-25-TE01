# LLM-Based Network Security Analysis System

This project presents a comprehensive approach to network security analysis using Large Language Models (LLMs). The system leverages both fine-tuning techniques and prompting strategies to detect and analyze network threats, providing detailed reports and recommendations for security professionals.

## Project Overview

The system utilizes state-of-the-art Large Language Models to analyze network traffic data, identify potential security threats, and provide detailed analysis and recommendations. It employs multiple approaches including:

- **Fine-tuning**: Custom model adaptations for specialized network security tasks
- **Few-shot prompting**: Using limited examples to guide the model
- **Zero-shot prompting**: Leveraging the model's inherent capabilities without examples

The project includes both the AI models and a user-friendly web interface for security analysts.

## Key Features

- Real-time network traffic analysis
- Detection of common attack patterns (DDoS, SQL injection, etc.)
- Detailed analysis report generation
- Comparison of different LLM approaches for security analysis
- User-friendly web interface for monitoring and analysis

## Model Approaches

### Fine-tuning Approach

Custom fine-tuning of various LLM models (Mistral, Llama 3) for specialized network security analysis tasks.

### Prompting Techniques

- **Few-shot prompting**: Using limited examples to guide the model for specific security analysis tasks
- **Zero-shot prompting**: Leveraging the model's inherent capabilities without examples

## Performance Comparison
