      "\n",
      "To reason through the network flow log, let's break down the key features:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Source IP (172.16.0.5)**: This IP address is likely a private IP address, indicating it belongs to a local network (e.g., a router or a server within a corporate network). Private IP addresses are not routable on the internet, which makes it less likely that this IP is involved in a DDoS attack originating from the internet.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Destination IP (192.168.50.1)**: This IP address is also a private IP address, suggesting it is a target within the same local network as the source IP. This could indicate legitimate internal communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Source Port (842)**: Ports in the range of 1024 to 49151 are often used for legitimate internal services, which includes network services like DNS, SSH, and more. The specific port number (842) is not typically associated with malicious traffic.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Destination Port (21484)**: This port number is not commonly associated with legitimate internal services, but without more context, it's difficult to say for certain. However, the fact that it's a private IP address destination suggests it's not a typical target for external DDoS attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Protocol (17)**: This refers to the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which is commonly used for applications like DNS, DHCP, and online gaming. UDP is not typically used for DDoS attacks, as it's not designed to handle large amounts of data in a reliable manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Flow Duration (-0.1944709240047926)**: A negative duration is unusual in network flow logs, as most flows are expected to have a positive duration. This could indicate a very short-lived connection, which might be legitimate, such as a DNS query or a brief network probe.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Total Fwd Packets (0.3251184533735609)**: The number of forward packets is very low, indicating a possible misconfigured or isolated network service.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Total Backward Packets (-0.1451238114943991)**: The negative number of backward packets further supports the notion of a short-lived connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Flow Bytes/s (-0.4163960526841666)**: The negative byte rate indicates a very low data transfer, which is consistent with the other features of this flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given these characteristics, the flow appears to be a legitimate, short-lived internal communication between two devices within the same local network. The lack of typical DDoS indicators (e.g., large numbers of packets, unusual protocols, or IP addresses associated with known DDoS traffic) suggests this is not a DDoS attack.\n",

      "* The total forward packets (-1.2073357999239012) and backward packets (-0.1451238114943991) are negative, which is unusual and may indicate that the traffic is not actually moving from the source to the destination. This could suggest that the traffic is being generated from a local network or a private IP address.\n",
